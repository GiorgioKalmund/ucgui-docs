## Description

ImageStyles currently have _no_ static presets. Images are simply
created based on Unity's default configurations (i.e. 100x100 size, etc.).

However, the ImageComponent still implements IStylable so you can easily create your own custom ImageStyle. 
This class will maybe contain some defaults in the future.

## Implementation
