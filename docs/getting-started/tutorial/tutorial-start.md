## Welcome to UCGUI!

In this little mini-series I will try to tech you some of the basics of UCGUI.
Ranging from design decisions, to inspirations, and some nice hacks and tricks.

If you have already used UCGUI and maybe just need a bit of a refresher you might want 
to take a look at the [quickstart page](../quickstart.md) instead for a quick refresher.
If you are new here, welcome! I hope UCGUI can provide at least a bit of value for
you / your team :).

This tutorial aims to cover most of the basics, so you can get straight into it afterwards.
If you want even more information about a specific component then feel free to 
simply check out its deidicated page under 'Components'!

_At the bottom of the page there are always buttons to the \<< previous and next \>> page or category, allowing
you to easily jump back and forward._

Enough yapping, let's GO!
